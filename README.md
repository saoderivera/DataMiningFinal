# Especial considerations

1. Main is PYQ5 application, thus, pyq5 needs to be installed in the computer in order to execute this app.

2. The application also uses graphviz-2.38, be user to have it installed in the computer

    The directory that uses this application for graphviz-2.38 is 
       'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\graphviz-2.38\\release\\bin'
    If you have it installed in another path, change this path at the top of the Main.py file.

3.The applicaiton also uses a font_size_window = 'font-size:15px' at the top of the Main.py file, if you wich , it can be changed, just be sure to use the correct sintax for your stylesheet font size.
